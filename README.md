# Amplitude Envelope:
Time domain audio feature extracted from raw audio waveform.
The maximum amplitude values among all samples in each frame make up the signal's Amplitude Envelope. This feature provides rough estimation of loudness.
It is however, sensitive to outliers. This feature has been extensively used for onset detection and music genre classification.

However, it is sensitive to outliers (more than Root Mean Square (RMS) Energy audio feature). This feature has been widely employed in the identification of onsets and the classification of music genres.
